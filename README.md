# basketball-score

the goal of the project is to create a basketball scoreboard with 6 functioning buttons to track the score.

i want to add a reset/new game button because the idea of not being able to reset it stresses me out.

this is my first javascript project. i am supposed to know enough to complete this project from the scrimba frontend dev course but i am worried i dont. the syntax is very different from css and html. i feel like i just got a handle on those and now im jumping into the deep end of javascript.
